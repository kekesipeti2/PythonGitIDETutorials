Some extra thoughts:

 - To select which files you want to commit, you should **stage** them before commiting.
 - You should add a **commit message** to each commit, in which you should describe which things you changed/added/removed.
 - Using different branches helps negate conflicts between each other.
 - Commit as many times as you'd like (you basically use this as a checkpoint in a video game), but only merge when one functionality is completely complete.
 - Pushing regularly to your own remote branch is possible, but you do not have to do it.
